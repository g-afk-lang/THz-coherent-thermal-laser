How it works: An optical cavity and beam splitter generates thermal photons via a heating element attached to a one way mirror, pumps gas molecules (e.g., nitrous oxide, N₂O, or methyl fluoride, CH₃F) in the cavity, causing them to vibrate and rotate. The rotational energy differences emit THz photons as "leftover" energy, building up into a laser beam through stimulated emission. This produces a coherent THz thermal photon gas with tunable frequency.

Steps to implement:

Prepare the gas cell: Fill a sealed tube (e.g., 1-2 m long) with low-pressure gas (~1-10 Torr) like N₂O.

Pump with thermal photon gas: heat with pulsed or continuous infrared packets into the gas to excite molecular rotations.

Extract THz: Use mirrors to form a resonant cavity; THz photons build up and exit as a beam (e.g., 0.1-3 THz, energies up to mJ per pulse).
